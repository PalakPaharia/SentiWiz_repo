SentiWiz: Project Requirements Document

1. Introduction

Project Name: SentiWizPurpose: SentiWiz is a comprehensive sentiment analysis platform aimed at helping businesses extract actionable insights from customer feedback collected across various digital platforms. Using AI and machine learning, the platform provides a centralized dashboard for tracking sentiment trends, customer reactions, and platform-wise insights to empower data-driven decision-making.

2. Objectives

Provide AI-powered sentiment detection and emotion analysis.

Helps in understanding the overall customer perception.

Track brand reputation across social media and review platforms.

Keeps marketing and customer service teams aligned with public opinion.

Generate downloadable reports for internal communication and insights.

Reduces manual reporting overhead and ensures consistency.

Allow historical and real-time insights using intuitive dashboards.

Enables performance comparison over time.

Ensure scalability, security, and ease of maintenance.

Designed to grow with user base and feature set.

3. Scope

In-Scope (MVP):

Email-based authentication using Supabase with mandatory verification.

Sentiment data extraction only from Instagram (Graph API).

Dashboard components:

Total Comments: Total data points collected.

Sentiment Trend: Graphical emotion timeline.

Word Cloud: Frequently used terms.

Tag Sentiments: Contextual emotion mapping.

Trend Alerts: Sudden spikes in sentiment/emotion.

Global filter for Last 7 Days, Last Month, and Custom Date Range.

Report scheduler with CSV and PDF outputs via email.

Settings and Support pages for managing account and issue resolution.

Future Scope:

Additional platforms: Google Reviews, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and website review plugins.

SentiWiz Agent: Chatbot/LLM module for natural language interaction with insights.

Notification system for trend-based triggers.

Role-based access (Team Members, Viewers).

OAuth-based sign-in (Google, Microsoft, etc.).

4. User Roles

Business Admin (MVP-only role):

Full platform access.

Can manage integrations, view reports, and trigger data sync.

Primary user type for businesses.

5. Functional Requirements

Authentication:

Sign-up/login via Supabase.

Restrict access until email is verified.

Secure token/session management.

Platform Integration:

Instagram fully functional.

UI tiles available for other platforms (disabled initially).

Dashboard Components:

Global filters apply across all components.

Sentiment calculations displayed using visual charts (Recharts).

Data dynamically updates based on time range selected.

Reports Module:

Exportable CSV and PDF with sentiment summaries.

Email delivery and UI-based downloads.

Scheduled jobs managed via cron/backend tasks.

UI Implementation:

Built using TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui for responsiveness.

Logo-themed color palette.

Mobile-first and desktop responsive layouts.

6. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

Caching to reduce repeated API load.

Lazy loading of dashboard tiles.

Scalability:

Modular backend allows easy addition of new platforms.

Stateless API design for better concurrency handling.

Security:

Supabase RLS ensures user-level data separation.

JWT tokens and secure session handling.

Maintainability:

Code organized with reusable modules.

Well-documented API and logic separation.

Availability:

Designed for 99.5% uptime using serverless and managed services.

7. Technical Stack

Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui

React’s component-based structure supports reusable logic.

TypeScript ensures type safety.

Tailwind allows fast, consistent design iteration.

Backend: Node.js (with optional Firebase Functions), Python for NLP/ML logic

Node.js handles API logic, task scheduling.

Python powers sentiment analysis using ML models.

Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

Reliable, open-source PostgreSQL DB.

Easy integration with RLS for per-user data access.

Authentication: Supabase Auth

Email-only sign-up for now.

Easy integration with frontend and RLS enforcement.

Scheduler: Backend cron tasks or job queues

Used for timed sentiment sync and report delivery.

Reporting: Puppeteer/Playwright for PDF rendering, custom logic for CSV

Enables dynamic, styled reports with accurate data snapshots.

Visualization: Recharts

Highly customizable and responsive charting library for trends.

8. Database Schema Overview

Users Table

id, email, verified_at, created_at

Central user identity and verification info.

Sessions Table

session_id, user_id, token

Stores active sessions securely.

Platforms Table

id, user_id, platform_name, is_connected, created_at

Tracks user-specific integrations.

Comments Table

id, user_id, platform_id, text, timestamp, sentiment, tags

Main data source for analysis and trends.

Reports Table

id, user_id, file_type, date_range, file_url, created_at

Tracks generated reports for UI download and history.

9. Supabase Policies (RLS)

RLS ensures that users can only access their data.

Users: Only logged-in users can view their own record.

Platforms/Comments/Reports: Filtered by user_id match.

RLS prevents accidental or malicious data leaks.

10. External APIs & Integrations

Currently: Instagram Graph API (MVP).

Future Integrations:

Google Business Reviews API

YouTube Data API

Twitter (X) Developer API

LinkedIn Public Comments API

These APIs will allow sentiment extraction across broader social footprints.

11. Assumptions

All users register with an email.

Each business manages its own account and integrations.

Some platforms may have API rate limits or review policies.

12. Constraints

Instagram is the only active platform at MVP.

Email verification required before accessing dashboard.

Reporting depends on successfully fetched and analyzed data.

13. Open Questions

What’s the timeline for onboarding the next platform?

Should ML models vary platform-wise for precision?

Do we prioritize PWA/mobile optimization in Phase 1?
